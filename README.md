Debugging

Issue 1:
   Code did not perform how intended.
    - Turtle made a circle without drawing squares.
    - I realized I had the turtle turning 1 degree 360 times but did not incorporate my code to draw a square.
Solution:
    - I added the square code to the for loop.

Issue 2:
   Turtle was rotating too many times.
     - I realized the for loop had the turtle turn multiple times.
Solution:
     - I divided the amount of loops by how many times the turn was included each loop.
